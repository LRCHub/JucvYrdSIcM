Archie: If that's what it is
Then that's what it is
You're probably right to just forget it
Lets face it you've worked so hard and now you're scarred
And free of any hope
I guess you should mope
Forget what you've planned
Hey, I understand
If that's what it is
Then that's what it is
Though that's not the way I choose to see it
I have my own view that works with all these jerks and unenlightened fools
I make my own rules, I do what I can
If I hit the wall then maybe its all a part of the plan
Tomorrow will come, today will be gone
And so I put one foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
And just keep walking on
Patrice: If that's what it is
Archie: If that's what it is
Patrice: What also is true
Archie: What also is true
Patrice & Archie: Is it may not always be disaster
Patrice: I realize that now it is but how it is
Isn't how its got be
Another day comes, another day goes
And if I get teased or hurt or lied to or punched in the nose
I say I wont cry
I cry until dawn
And then I put one foot in front of the other
Patrice & Archie: One foot in front of the other
Patrice: And just keep walking on
Evan: I'm becoming a man
Maybe all that it means is
I face the world for what it is
And not what I wish it could be
I'm becoming a man
Wanting everything fall into place
I swing, I miss
I'll get through this
I almost guarantee
One day I'll be thirty
One day I'll be fine
One day I'll make fun of this dramatic life of mine
One day I'll be older
And then I'll write a book
About the choices that I made
Patrice: The choices that you made
Evan: And the chances that I took
Patrice: The chances that you--
Archie: If that's what it is
Then that's what it is
At least until Disney can re-write it
We put our shoes and socks and take the knocks
And wish that it would change
Patrice: And maybe it will
Evan: And maybe it can
Archie: Until then you trust that all this is just becoming a man
Patrice: You take your best shot
All three: Cause look what you've got
Patrice: Go on and put one foot in front of the other
Evan: One foot in front of the other
Archie: One foot in front of the other
Evan: One foot in front of the other
Archie: The crip, the geek, the jew and his mother
Patrice: And just keep walking on
