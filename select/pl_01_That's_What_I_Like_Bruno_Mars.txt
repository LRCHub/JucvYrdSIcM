I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl what's happening
You and your ass invited
So go and get to clapping
Girl pop it for
Pop pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
*
Jump in the Cadillac
Girl let's put some miles on it
Anything you want
Just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby you deserve it all
And I'm going to give it to you
**
Gold jewelry shinning so bright
Strawberry champagne all night
Lucky for you that's what I like
That's what I like
Lucky for you that's what I like
That's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you that's what I like
That's what I like
Lucky for you that's what I like
That's what I like
I'm talking trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl I'll be your freako
Mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile aint gon never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everyday 24 karats
Now take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (Is it you?)
Is it me? (Is it me?)
Say it's us (Say it's us)
And I'll agree baby
* Repeat
** Repeat
You say you want a good time
Well here I am baby here I am baby
Talk to me talk to me talk to me
Tell me what on your mind
If you want it girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby tell me tell me baby
What you trying to do
** Repeat
